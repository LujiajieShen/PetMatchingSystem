This is a readme for Pair Pal!

In order to build our system, one would have to run the program a couple times to generate a build-pairpal-... and a build-pairpalwidgets-... folder.
Once this folder is generated, one could copy the database found in the pairPalWidgets folder. Then pasting it in the build-pairpalwidgets and the build-pairpal folders.
Once this is done, one should be able to run the Pair Pal Widgets program in QTcreator and interact with the application without any problems.

Thank you for using Pair Pal!
